        <h1> Presentation </h1>
        My name is Léon SCHER, I am 18 years old, and I live in Sausheim, in the Haut-Rhin. I love computers, video games, sports, and cooking. I am a motivated, ambitious, and calm person. I got my Brevet des collèges in 2019 at the collège Jules Verne in Illzach. Then, I went to the Lycée Jean-Henri Lambert in Mulhouse, where I obtained my baccalaureate diploma with specialties in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry and Earth Sciences.

        <h1> Why did I choose the Bachelor in Networks and Telecommunications ? </h1>
            I chose the Bachelor in Networks and telecommunications course because I always liked computers, how they works, and how to create things via the internet. I am very interested in cyber security, and it is covered in this course. I love to see how protection systems are managed on websites, servers etc, and how hackers can - or can't get past these protection systems. I've been there for almost 3 months now, and I really like the way it works, and especially the topics covered in this course. I'm going to give myself the means to succeed, because that's what I'd like to work in later!
